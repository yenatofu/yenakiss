All rights reserved. No permission is given to take, copy or redistrubute any part of this code.
It is freely admitted that some of the commands Yenakiss utilises has been influenced by, but NOT copied, from other discord.js bots, as Yenakiss aims to be the most feature/command rich Discord bot available and I lack imagination.

## Selfhosting
Selfhosting Yenakiss is not supported, encouraged or wanted. Many important files are NOT included in this repo, and the internal structure utilised is completely customised to my liking, (so you won't find any util folders here).
